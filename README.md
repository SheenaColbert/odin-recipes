# odin-recipes
project will consit of a main index page with links to several other recipes. 
I will have demonstrated my knowledge of html basics by the end of this project.
Key points that I have learned so far is that when linking a page in your project to another page make sure to add a 
text description of the page so that it is clickable. 
When linking images from anotherpage make sure to use the relative path so that the image will appear onthe page.
